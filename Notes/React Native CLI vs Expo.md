Expo and React Native CLI represent two different approaches to building mobile applications, each with distinct characteristics and use cases.

## Key Differences

**Development Setup**
- Expo offers a simplified setup process taking about 10 minutes for physical devices[3]
- React Native CLI requires manual configuration of native development environments, taking 2-3 hours for initial setup[3]

**Development Experience**
- Expo manages configurations through JSON files, eliminating native code interactions[4]
- React Native CLI requires direct management of native code and dependencies[1]

## Expo Advantages

**Development Speed**
- Faster development with pre-built components and libraries[8]
- Over-the-air updates capability
- Cloud builds through EAS, allowing iOS development without a Mac[10]

**Accessibility**
- Cross-platform development without platform-specific requirements
- Suitable for developers without native mobile development experience[1]
- Excellent for learning and prototyping[3]

## Expo Limitations

**Technical Constraints**
- Limited access to certain native modules and features[5]
- Larger app bundle sizes
- Less control over build configuration[5]

## React Native CLI Advantages

**Flexibility**
- Full access to native modules and code[6]
- Complete control over build configuration
- Better performance optimization capabilities[5]

## Which Should You Learn?

For beginners, starting with Expo is recommended because:
- Faster setup and learning curve[7]
- Focus on React Native concepts without native code complexity[6]
- Ability to later transition to React Native CLI if needed[6]

However, if your project requires extensive native customization or performance optimization, React Native CLI would be more suitable[5].

## Professional Perspective

Many professional development companies, including Infinite Red, Callstack, and STRV, now use Expo for their projects[10]. The platform has evolved significantly, addressing previous limitations and becoming a robust solution for production applications[1].
