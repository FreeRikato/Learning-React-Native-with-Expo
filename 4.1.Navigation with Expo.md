### **Introduction to Expo Router**

Expo Router is a file-based, open-source routing library for Universal React Native apps built with Expo. It enables seamless navigation across platforms (Android, iOS, and web) by automatically converting files in the app directory into routes.

---

### **Key Features**
1. **Native**: Built on React Navigation for platform-optimized navigation.
2. **Shareable**: Deep linkable screens for easy content sharing.
3. **Offline-First**: Works offline with automatic updates for new versions.
4. **Optimized**: Lazy-evaluated routes and deferred bundling for better performance.
5. **Universal**: Unified navigation for all platforms, with platform-specific API support.
6. **Discoverable**: Static rendering for SEO and universal linking for search engine indexing.

---

### **Why Use Expo Router?**
- Simplified navigation with file-based routing.
- Automatic features like typed routes, universal linking, and static rendering.
- Improved refactoring, deep linking, and development speed through Async Routes.
- Built-in support for analytics and re-engagement features like notifications.

---

### **Compatibility with Other Libraries**
- You can use React Navigation or other libraries with Expo. However, Expo Router is recommended for its advanced features.
- React Native Navigation by Wix is incompatible with Expo Go and `expo-dev-client`.

---

### **Common Benefits**
- Easier onboarding and scaling with file-based routing.
- Seamless web and native navigation.
- Automatic bundle splitting and sitemap generation.
- Enhanced user experiences with deep linking and SEO.

---

### **Server Rendering**
Basic static rendering is supported. Server-side rendering requires custom infrastructure.

**Expo Router** streamlines navigation, boosts development efficiency, and brings advanced web-like features to React Native apps.

---

### **Quick Start: Creating a New Project**

#### Step 1: Create a New Expo App
Use the `create-expo-app` command to set up a new project with Expo Router already installed and configured.

```bash
npx create-expo-app@latest
```

#### Step 2: Start the Project
Start your new project with the following command:

```bash
npx expo start
```

**Tips:**
- **Mobile Device:** Use **Expo Go** to view your app on a mobile device.  
- **Web Browser:** Open the app in a browser by pressing **w** in the terminal UI.  
- **Android/iOS Simulators:** Press **a** for Android (requires Android Studio) or **i** for iOS (requires macOS with Xcode).

---

### **Manual Installation: Adding Expo Router to an Existing Project**

If your project was created with Expo but doesn't have Expo Router installed, follow these steps:

#### **Prerequisites**
Ensure your computer is set up to run Expo apps.

---

#### Step 1: Install Required Dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary libraries compatible with your Expo SDK version:

For **SDK 50 and above** or **SDK 49 and below**:

```bash
npx expo install expo-router react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens expo-linking expo-constants expo-status-bar
```

---

#### Step 2: Set Up Entry Point

In your `package.json` file, configure the `main` property to use `expo-router/entry`:

```json
{
  "main": "expo-router/entry"
}
```

---

#### Step 3: Configure Deep Linking

Add a **deep linking scheme** in your app configuration file (`app.json`):

```json
{
  "scheme": "your-app-scheme"
}
```

**For Web Support:**
- Install additional dependencies:

  ```bash
  npx expo install react-native-web react-dom
  ```

- Enable Metro bundler for web in `app.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "web": {
      "bundler": "metro"
    }
  }
  ```

---

#### Step 4: Update Babel Configuration

Ensure your `babel.config.js` uses `babel-preset-expo` as the preset:

```javascript
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
  };
};
```

**Important:**  
For Expo Router v3 (SDK 50 and above), remove `plugins: ['expo-router/babel']` from older configurations, as it has been merged into `babel-preset-expo`.

---

#### Step 5: Clear Bundler Cache

After updating the Babel configuration, clear the cache with:

```bash
npx expo start -c
```

---

#### Step 6: Update Resolutions (if upgrading)

- **SDK 50 and above**: Remove outdated Yarn resolutions or npm overrides from `package.json`, such as:
  - `metro`
  - `metro-resolver`
  - `react-refresh`

---

### **Summary**
- For **new projects**, use `npx create-expo-app@latest` for a pre-configured setup.  
- For **existing projects**, manually install dependencies, update configurations, and clean the cache to integrate Expo Router.  
---

### **Creating Pages with Expo Router**

Expo Router uses a **file-based routing convention**, where files created in the `app` directory automatically become routes in your app. Below is an organized and structured overview of how to work with this convention effectively.

---

### **File-Based Routing**

#### **Example Routes**
The file structure in the `app` directory directly translates to application routes:

```text
app/
  index.tsx         --> Matches '/'
  home.tsx          --> Matches '/home'
  [user].tsx        --> Matches dynamic paths like '/expo' or '/evanbacon'
  settings/
    index.tsx       --> Matches '/settings'
```

#### **Defining Pages**
A page is a file in the `app` directory that exports a React component as the default export. The supported file extensions are `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, and `.tsx`.

**Example: `app/index.tsx`**

```javascript
import { Text } from 'react-native';

export default function Page() {
  return <Text>Top-level page</Text>;
}
```

- The above code matches the `/` route for all platforms.  
- Files named `index` match the parent directory (e.g., `app/settings/index.tsx` matches `/settings`).

---

### **Platform-Specific Extensions**

Expo Router supports platform-specific extensions (e.g., `.ios.tsx`, `.web.tsx`) starting from version 3.5.x. A non-platform-specific file must exist for default implementation across platforms.

#### **Example Structure**

```text
app/
  _layout.tsx         --> Layout for all platforms
  _layout.web.tsx     --> Layout for web only
  index.tsx           --> Home page for all platforms
  about.tsx           --> About page for all platforms
  about.web.tsx       --> About page for web
```

In this structure:
- `_layout.web.tsx` applies only to the web, while `_layout.tsx` applies to other platforms.
- `about.tsx` is the default for all platforms, while `about.web.tsx` overrides it for web.

---

### **Dynamic Routes**

Dynamic routes allow you to create pages that match variable paths using square brackets (`[ ]`).

#### **Examples**
| **Route**             | **Matched URL**        |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| `app/blog/[slug].tsx`  | `/blog/123`           |
| `app/blog/[...rest].tsx` | `/blog/123/settings` |

- Routes with higher specificity (e.g., `blog/bacon.tsx`) take precedence over dynamic routes (e.g., `blog/[id].tsx`).
- The `rest` syntax (`[...param]`) captures multiple segments.

#### **Accessing Dynamic Parameters**
Parameters are accessible using `useLocalSearchParams`:

**Example: `app/blog/[slug].tsx`**

```javascript
import { useLocalSearchParams } from 'expo-router';
import { Text } from 'react-native';

export default function Page() {
  const { slug } = useLocalSearchParams();
  return <Text>Blog post: {slug}</Text>;
}
```

---

### **Non-Route Files**

The `app` directory is reserved exclusively for routes and layouts. Non-route files like components, hooks, and utilities should not be placed here. This ensures a clean and structured project.

#### **Example Issue**
In a project with the following structure:

```text
app/
  (home)/
    _layout.tsx
    profile.tsx    --> Matches '/profile'
  (modal)/
    _layout.tsx
    profile.tsx    --> Matches '/profile'
```

Having multiple route directories (`(home)` and `(modal)`) makes it unclear where non-route files like `ProfileImageComponent.tsx` belong. To avoid such dilemmas, non-route files must reside outside the `app` directory.

---

### **Recommended Project Structure**

**Separate routes and components by functionality:**

```text
app/
  sign-in/          --> Route: /sign-in
  sign-out/         --> Route: /sign-out
  profile/          --> Route: /profile
  tasks/            --> Route: /tasks
components/
  authentication/   --> Shared components for authentication
  tasks/
    overview/       --> Components for task-related features
  profile/
    [user]/         --> Components for user profile
```

- **Advantages**:
  - Components remain grouped by feature, making them reusable.
  - Routes are independent of component structure, simplifying refactoring.

---

### **Optimizing with Path Aliases**

Use path aliases to make your imports structure-agnostic, preventing long or fragile import paths. For example:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@components/*": ["./components/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

This allows you to import components like:

```javascript
import UserProfile from '@components/profile/UserProfile';
```

--- 
### Navigate between pages

#### **How Does Navigation Work in Expo Router?**

Expo Router uses `Link` components to navigate between pages, analogous to how `<a>` tags with `href` attributes work on the web.

Example file structure:
```text
app/
├── index.tsx
├── about.tsx
└── user/[id].tsx
```

Here’s a basic example:
```tsx
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { Link } from 'expo-router';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Link href="/about">About</Link>
      <Link href="/user/bacon">View user</Link>
    </View>
  );
}
```

- **What happens when you tap a link?**
  - `/about` navigates to the "About" page.
  - `/user/bacon` navigates to the "User" page dynamically using the `id` parameter.

---

#### **How Can I Use Buttons for Navigation?**

By default, `Link` wraps its content in a `<Text>` component for accessibility. You can customize this using the `asChild` prop.

Example:
```tsx
import { Pressable, Text } from 'react-native';
import { Link } from 'expo-router';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <Link href="/other" asChild>
      <Pressable>
        <Text>Go to Other</Text>
      </Pressable>
    </Link>
  );
}
```

- **What does `asChild` do?**
  It forwards props like `onPress` to the child component (e.g., `<Pressable>`).

---

#### **How Does Native Navigation Work?**

Expo Router uses a stack-based navigation model. Each new route is added to a stack, like a stack of cards.

- **Example:**
  - Navigate from `/feed` to `/profile` → Stack: `['/feed', '/profile']`.
  - Then navigate to `/settings` → Stack: `['/feed', '/profile', '/settings']`.

Expo Router supports **parallel routing** (independent child stacks). Example:
```text
Parent Stack
├── Tabs Layout
│   ├── /apple
│   └── /orange
├── Stack Layout
    ├── /carrot
    └── /potato
```

Each tab has its own independent navigation history.

---

#### **How Do I Navigate Back?**

To navigate backward in the stack:
- **`back()`**: Moves to the previous screen in the current stack.
- **`dismiss()`**: Exits the current stack only.
- **`dismissTo()`**: Moves to a specific route in the stack or pushes it if not found.

---

#### **What Is Relative Navigation?**

Relative URLs (like `./`) let you navigate based on the current screen.

Example:
```tsx
<Link href="./article" relativeToDirectory>Go to Article</Link>
```

- **What’s the difference between `./` and `../`?**
  - `./`: Relative to the current directory.
  - `../`: Moves up one directory level.

| **Href**         | **Current URL** | **Result**              |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| `./article`       | `/route/v1`     | `/route/article`        |
| `../article`      | `/route/v1`     | `/article`              |

---

#### **How Can I Link to Dynamic Routes?**

Dynamic routes (e.g., `/user/[id]`) can accept parameters.

Example:
```tsx
<Link href={{ pathname: '/user/[id]', params: { id: 'bacon' } }}>View User</Link>
```

---

#### **What Are `push`, `replace`, and Other Navigation Methods?**

1. **`push`**:
   - Always adds a new route to the stack.
   - Example:
     ```tsx
     <Link push href="/feed">Login</Link>
     ```

2. **`replace`**:
   - Replaces the current screen without adding to the stack.
   - Example:
     ```tsx
     <Link replace href="/feed">Login</Link>
     ```

3. **Using the `router` object imperatively**:
   ```tsx
   import { router } from 'expo-router';

   router.replace('/login');
   ```

---

#### **How Can I Leverage TypeScript for Safer Navigation?**

Expo Router generates static TypeScript types for all routes. This enables:
- Autocomplete for `href` values.
- Compile-time validation of invalid links.

---

#### **What About Web Behavior?**

On the web, `Link` enables client-side navigation, which is faster and preserves state. The `<a>` element is supported but performs a full-page reload.

---

#### **How Can I Test Navigation in Simulators?**

To emulate deep links in simulators:
- Use Android Emulator’s `adb` commands.
- Use Xcode’s deep link testing for iOS.
